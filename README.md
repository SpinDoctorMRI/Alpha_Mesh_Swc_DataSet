# Alpha_Mesh_Swc_DataSet
Dataset of surface meshes produced by Alpha_Mesh_Swc, which is available here https://github.com/SpinDoctorMRI/Alpha_Mesh_Swc_DataSet.

The meshes are saved in .ply files and in some cases we provide the log files containing information about the meshing process. In the publication associated with the Alpha_Mesh_Swc tool, we tested our method against a data set of 1000 Neurons. These are available in the 1000_surface_meshes folder and the Swc files are available in 1000_swc_files.zip.
